# Temperature Control (in progress)

Stack: HTML, SCSS, React

Single-day React project that allows you to change the temperature and changes the background depending on the temperature.

## MVP

-   Create a few components that modify one another
-   A plus and minus button to modify temperature
-   Temperature displayed on screen

## Styling ideas:

-   Yellow and warm tones
-   Blue highlights
-   Fire aesthetic

## Responsiveness

-   Mobile first design as I view this as a mobile website first and foremost (e.g. controlling air conditioning units via an app)
-   Available down to screen sizes of 350px (this is narrower than the Galaxy S10, Galaxy Note 10 and iPhone 11).

## Special Mobile Design

As this is intended to be a mobile app, not only did I decide to use the mobile first design concept in terms of responsiveness, I also included the manifest.json file and got acquainted with what information to include.

## SEO Specs

Since in this hypothetical application, the users would be required to find this app in order to change the temperature of this application, I decided to use the opportunity to acquaint myself with more SEO concepts, including

-   title tag
-   meta tags: description, Twitter cards, viewport
-   specialised use of header tags
-   use of alt tags on all images
-   changing of title when in different tab (from Daikin Temperature Control to Change temperature)
